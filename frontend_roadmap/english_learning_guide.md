# Technical English Learning Guide for Frontend Engineers

## Daily Practice Structure (20-30 minutes)

### 1. Technical Vocabulary Building
- Learn 5 new technical terms each day related to your current topic
- Create flashcards with the term, definition, and example usage
- Review previous days' terms regularly

### 2. Documentation Reading Practice
- Spend 10 minutes daily reading official documentation
- Start with simpler docs like React or CSS
- Gradually move to more complex docs like Next.js or TypeScript
- Highlight unknown words and look them up

### 3. Video Learning with Subtitles
- Watch one short (5-10 minute) tutorial video daily with English subtitles
- First watch with subtitles in your native language if available
- Then watch again with English subtitles
- Finally try watching without subtitles

### 4. Writing Practice
- Write code comments in English
- Document your learning in a daily journal (even just 3-5 sentences)
- Try explaining a concept you learned in simple English

## Tips for Learning Technical English

1. **Focus on understanding, not perfect grammar**
   - Technical communication values clarity over perfect grammar
   - Most documentation follows similar patterns you can learn

2. **Learn in context**
   - Always learn new words while working on actual code
   - Connect English terms to concepts you already understand

3. **Use visual resources**
   - Diagrams and illustrations can help bridge language gaps
   - Video tutorials with visual demonstrations reduce language dependency

4. **Build a personal glossary**
   - Create your own dictionary of terms you've learned
   - Add examples from your own code

5. **Join English-speaking coding communities**
   - Even just reading discussions helps improve comprehension
   - Start by asking simple questions when you feel ready
