# Getting Started Guide: Your First Steps

## How to Start Using Your Frontend Roadmap

### Day 1: Simple Setup (30-45 minutes total)

#### Step 1: Save the Roadmap Files (5 minutes)
- Download all the files I've sent you to your computer
- Create a folder called "Frontend Roadmap" to store them
- Open the main roadmap file to review the overall plan

#### Step 2: Set Up Week 1, Day 1 Only (10 minutes)
- Open the "week1_tasks.md" file
- Look only at Day 1-2 tasks (React Hooks Review)
- Choose just ONE small task to start with

#### Step 3: Prepare Your Learning Environment (10 minutes)
- Clear a space on your desk
- Open VS Code or your preferred code editor
- Create a new folder for your practice code
- Have a notebook or document ready for notes

#### Step 4: Set a Timer for Just 25 Minutes (25 minutes)
- Start with the smallest task from Day 1
- Work on it for just 25 minutes
- Take notes on what you learn
- Stop when the timer ends, even if not finished

#### Step 5: Record Your Progress (5 minutes)
- Write down what you accomplished today
- Note any questions or challenges
- Feel good about taking the first step!

### What to Expect on Day 1

Your goal for Day 1 is NOT to complete everything or understand everything perfectly. Your only goal is to START and spend 25 focused minutes learning. This builds the habit of showing up, which is the foundation of consistency.

## Daily English Practice Routine (15-20 minutes)

### Simple Daily English Practice

#### Morning Vocabulary (5 minutes)
1. Choose 3 technical terms from this list for Day 1:

#### Reading Practice (5-10 minutes)
1. Read this short paragraph about React:
   "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses components to create reusable pieces of code. Components can have state, which is data that can change. When state changes, React updates the user interface automatically."
